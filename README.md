> _"Freedom Two is the freedom to help your neighbor by distributing copies of the program. Now, for beings that can think and learn, sharing useful knowledge is a fundamental act of friendship.

And, in fact, this spirit of goodwill—the spirit of helping your neighbor, voluntarily—is society’s most important resource."_
